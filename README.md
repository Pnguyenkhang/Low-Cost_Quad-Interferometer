# Motivation
For this project, we wanted to be able to utilize a cheap store-bought laser and 3d printed mounts to simulate an expensive mach-zenhder interferometer which will plot real-time data of expansion.

# Quick Start
Use the package manager pip to install all required libraries
```bash
pip install notebook
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install serial
```

# Usage
We utilized Mu Editor and edit our code in circuit-python.

# List of Components

# 3D Print Files
These were the STL files for our mounts for the adafruit m0 trinket and the photodiode.
